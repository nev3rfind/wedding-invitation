## Common Problems & Solutions

### ‚ùå "npm: command not found"

**Solution**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
After installation, close and reopen your terminal, then try again.

### ‚ùå White screen or blank page

**Problem**: Environment variables not set correctly
**Solution**:

3. Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
4. Run `npm run dev` again

### ‚ùå "Port 5173 is already in use"

**Problem**: Another application is using that port
**Solution**: Run on a different port:

```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` instead.
